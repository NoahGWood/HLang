# HLang
The Hobo language is a programming language designed by hobos, for hobos.

## Requirements
* Python 3.5 or higher
* rply
* llvmlite
* gcc (optional, for compiling)
* llvm (optional, system install, for compiling)

## How do I use it?
Create a new file with the .hobo extension, add your code, and compile away!

## Okay but what's the actual syntax/grammar rules?
Well, there's not really anything formalized, that would have taken time away from the fun of programming.

Also, you can only really perform number manipulations and print to screen at the moment, but if you want to you can make up a mean program using something like:
print(1 * 2 - 5 / 3 + 2);

As you can see, HoboLang is very much in its' infancy and difficult to use because you'll have to implement every facet of the language yourself. We all know the more advanced and useful a language is, the more difficult it is to use, technically this makes HoboLang one of the most advanced programming languages in the world!

## How can I contribute?
See our [contribution guide](../master/Contributing.md)

## Why?
I love Python, but multi-threading and multi-processing in python *SUCKS*. I could just use C, but I think it'd be more useful to have a higher level language that can take advantage of the new ridiculous number of cores and threads that AMD and Intel are coming up.
